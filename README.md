# IOT_Smart_Street_Lighting_System

The Smart street light provides a solution for energy saving which is achieved by sensing an approaching vehicle using the Ultrasonic sensors and then switching ON a block of street lights ahead of the vehicle. As the vehicle passes by, the trailing lights switch OFF automatically. Thus, we save a lot of energy. So when there are no vehicles on the highway, then all the lights remain OFF.
